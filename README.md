# ECG_ResNet
- This repository contains the notebook code for classifying 12-Lead ECGs using Residual Neural Networks (ResNet).
- The ResNet was developed using PyTorch.
- The data can be found on: https://moody-challenge.physionet.org/2020/

# Future Considerations
- Make use of data augmentation techniques to address the major class imbalance problem in order to improve the performance of the ResNet. An option would be to augment the data via Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
